# Cuneiform-Image-Pipeline

#### Description
* Automated production of "fat-cross", a stitched image of 6 individual scans of ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets. 
* Tools: Python, OpenCV
#### What is Assyriology? 
* [Assyriology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyriology) is the archaeological, historical, and linguistic study of Assyria and the rest of ancient Mesopotamia and of the related cultures that used cuneiform writing. 

#### Data
* Image data for this project is provided by the [**Tablet Collection** at the Oriental Institute](https://oi.uchicago.edu/collections/tablet-collection-and-tablet-room) (The University of Chicago). I will not upload them here due to copyright concerns. 

#### Current Goal
- [ ] Increase the output success rate to 80% by improving the software. 
- [ ] Contribute to the [CDLI (Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative)](https://github.com/cdli-gh)'s open source projects to assist Assyriology 

#### Successful Output (May update)
