## Before you start
1.	If new with Photoshop, going over the [Photoshop tutorials](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/tutorials.html), freely accessible through both the Photoshop software and the Adobe website, is highly recommended. 
2.	The software version used in this instruction is Adobe Photoshop 20.0.4. 

## Naming conventions / Preparing image folders
**The following are assumed in this document:**
1. Scanned images are named according to the CDLI's [Submission Guideline](https://cdli.ox.ac.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=submission_guidelines). 
2. Each folder contains all scanned images of one tablet. 

## Importing scanned images to Photoshop
1.	`File` > `Scripts` > `Load Files into Stack...`
2.	When the pop-up screen titled `Load Layers` appears, in `Use:` select `Folder`.
3.	Click the `Browse...` button. When another pop-up screen titled `Open` appears, select the desired folder. Click `Select Folder`, and `Open` pop-up screen will disappear.
4.	Click `Ok` in the `Load Layers` pop-up screen. The `Load Layers` screen will disappear, and the software will import each scanned image into a tab.

## Modifying each scanned image 
There will generally be ***six layers*** of scanned images (bottom edge, left edge, obverse, reverse, right edge, top edge) imported. For each image/layer, do the following: 

1. Select `Rectangular Marquee tool (M)` from the tool bar at the left side.

2.	Right click on the image, and select `Select Inverse` . Press the `Delete` key on the keyboard. `Select Inverse` allows us to select all areas, excluding the tablet enclosed in the rectangle.

3.	In `Select` > `Select and Mask… (Alt+Ctrl+R)`. When `Properties` tab appear at the right side, adjust the following parameters. The following values are only for recommendation. You may adjust them depending on the image as you see fit. 

    a.	`Transparenty`: 20%
    
    b.	`Radius`: 3 px
    
    c.	Deselect `Smart Radius`
    
    d.	`Smooth`: 19
    
    e.	`Feather`: 2.4px
    
    f.	`Contrast`: 10%
    
    g.	`Shift Edge`: 0%
    
    h.	Deselect `Decontaminate Colors`
    
    i.	`Output To: Selection`
    
    j.	Select `Remember Settings`

4.	Click `Ok`, and the `Properties` tab will disappear. Once you have adjusted the properties, the software will remember the settings, and you will not be required to adjust them again. 

5.	Select `Magic Wand tool (W)` and click anywhere on the dark/black backround.
